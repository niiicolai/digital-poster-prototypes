### Step 2:

##### Download the repository to your local computer

1. Open your terminal
2. Find a location you want to save the repository (check 'Bash commands' for help)
3. Enter `git clone git@github.com:niiicolai/digital-poster-prototypes.git` to download the repository

You should now have downloaded a directory called `digital-poster-prototypes` and be ready to work in this repository.

### How to:

##### Git branching in short

- When you enter the directory `digital-poster-prototypes` first time, you will be on the master branch.
- The master branch is the main branch. This branch should be kept clean from experimental code and unready bug fixes.
- You will therefore need to create a new local branch where you do your modifications.
- To create a new branch: Enter `git checkout -b <branch-name>` in your terminal
- Use `git checkout <branch-name>` without the -b option to switch between branches

### Bash commands: 
- `ls` to list files and folders in the current directory 
- `mkdir <foldername>` to create a directory
- `cd <foldername>` to enter a directory
